### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Researcher at the intersection of ML and visualization. When I am not in front of my computer, you will probably find me in the mountains.
My research is at the intersection of AI and HCI. In this context, I am always searching for the best method to connect humans with AI systems. I try to help developers with techniques and visualizations that foster communication and provide insights during development and work on visualizations that help them understand the decisions their AI systems make.
