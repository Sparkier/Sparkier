### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Ph. D. student at Ulm University. When I am not in front of my computer, you will probably find me in the mountains.
My research is on visualization and explainability for neural networks. In this context, I am always interested in new methods to better understand artificial intelligence. I try to help developers with techniques and visualizations that foster communication and provide insights during development. For consumers of AI-powered applications, I work on visualizations that help them understand the decisions that these algorithms make.
